### Hadoop-Streaming: MapReduce Programming with Hadoop Streaming

This repository provides examples and code implementations for using Hadoop Streaming, a utility that allows users to write MapReduce programs in languages other than Java (such as Python, Perl, and Ruby). The repository is designed to help users understand the basics of Hadoop Streaming and how to develop and run custom MapReduce jobs on Hadoop clusters using different programming languages.

#### Key Features:

- **Introduction to Hadoop Streaming**: Explains the concept of Hadoop Streaming, which enables developers to use any executable or script as the Mapper and Reducer in a Hadoop environment.

- **MapReduce Examples in Python**: Provides sample scripts and examples of MapReduce programs written in Python, showcasing how to perform word count, data filtering, and other operations using Hadoop Streaming.

- **Practical Use Cases**: Demonstrates practical use cases of Hadoop Streaming for big data processing tasks, making it easier for users to understand how to leverage Hadoop with non-Java languages.

- **Sample Datasets**: Contains sample datasets to test the Hadoop Streaming jobs, allowing users to practice and understand the workflow of MapReduce with real data.


#### Who Should Use This Repository:

- **Data Engineers and Developers**: Those interested in using Hadoop for big data processing with languages like Python.
- **Students and Learners**: Individuals who want to understand the basics of Hadoop Streaming and gain hands-on experience with MapReduce programming.
